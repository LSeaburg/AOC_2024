# Advent of Code 2024

These are my solutions to the 2024 Advent of Code challenges that can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com).

All my solutions are in python.  I write my solutions in Jupyter Notebooks, but have converted them into standard python files so they are easier to read.

This repository does not include the inputs for the puzzles, as those are copyrighted.
